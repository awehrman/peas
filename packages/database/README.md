# `database`

A prisma instance to help us talk to a postgresql database. This was generated with `npx prisma init`.

Turbo will re-generate our schema, but you'll want to make sure you deploy your changes with:

```bash
  npx prisma db push
```

Use the prisma studio to view your database:

```bash
  npx prisma studio
```
