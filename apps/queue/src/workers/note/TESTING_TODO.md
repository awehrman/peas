# Note Worker Testing TODO

## âœ… COMPLETED - Base Infrastructure Testing

### âœ… Core Infrastructure (Base Components)

- [x] **BaseAction class** - Comprehensive tests for executeWithTiming, validateInput, withConfig
- [x] **NoOpAction** - Tests for no-operation execution and default properties
- [x] **ValidationAction** - Tests for validation logic and error handling
- [x] **LoggingAction** - Tests for logging with string and function messages, fallback behavior
- [x] **ActionFactory** - Tests for register, create, isRegistered, list methods and integration
- [x] **BaseWorker class** - Test worker lifecycle, job processing, and error handling

### âœ… Test Infrastructure Setup

- [x] **Test utilities** - Mock service container, action context, dependencies, and assertion helpers
- [x] **Test setup** - Enhanced test-setup.ts with proper mocking for Redis, BullMQ, and other dependencies
- [x] **Test data helpers** - Mock job data, parsed HTML files, and common test scenarios
- [x] **Assertion helpers** - Custom matchers for action testing patterns

### âœ… Test Coverage Achieved

- **BaseAction**: 18 tests covering execution, error handling, validation, and configuration
- **ActionFactory**: 17 tests covering registration, creation, and integration scenarios
- **BaseWorker**: 27 tests covering worker lifecycle, dependency management, and action wrapping
- **Total**: 62 tests with 100% pass rate (for base infrastructure)

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Continue with shared utility tests** - error handling, retry, status broadcasting, metrics
2. **Implement note action tests** - Use the established patterns for testing individual actions
3. **Add integration tests** - Test complete workflows and external dependencies
4. **Set up performance testing** - Establish baseline metrics and monitoring

## ðŸ“Š Current Status

- **Tests Created**: 62
- **Test Files**: 3
- **Coverage**: Base infrastructure components (BaseAction, ActionFactory, BaseWorker)
- **Next Priority**: Shared utility testing (error handling, retry, status broadcasting, metrics)
